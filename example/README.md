# Embed Example

The directories `parent` and `client` contain a full-featured example of using the App as an ES Module via Vite with TypeScript and Vue 3 `script setup` support.

## Installing

Run `yarn` in both directories.

## Running

First, build the library via a top-level `yarn build`.

Then, run `yarn dev` in both directories to start the Vite Dev Servers. Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the parent window.
